* Personal Recommendations
There is a wonderful lecture online:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0][Study Less Study Smart]], by Prof. Lobdell

* Disclaimer
These are my _personal_ notes, and as such, they will most probably have some
mistakes and under-developed /ideas/ (on which I aim to build, when I revisit
them in the future). If you want to contribute by pointing out an error[fn:1],
feel free to leave a comment.
