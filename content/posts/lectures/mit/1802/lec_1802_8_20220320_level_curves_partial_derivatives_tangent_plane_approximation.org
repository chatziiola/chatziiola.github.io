The course, to ensure simplicity, focuses on functions of 2 and 3 variables, but
everything discussed in my notes is applicable to functions of more variables as
well.

From geometry to functions of several functions.

* Introducing multivariable functions
Think of a random /ordinary/ function of one variable, such as:
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \sin{x}
\end{equation}

We have an easy way of dealing with these functions and that is by plotting them
in the form of $y = f(x)$:
[[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_sin.png]]

This can not be used, as is, for functions of more variables. It needs a slight
/modification/, since these functions would not normally be properly plotted on
the plane.

Let's now see what  a function of two variables looks like:
\begin{equation}
f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}: (x,y)\to f(x,y)
\end{equation}
It is just like any other function we already know (It has a domain of
definition, certain sets of input for which it may not be defined)!

Some examples of such functions are:

\begin{align*}
f(x,y)&=x^2+y^2\\
f(x,y)&=\sqrt{y}\\
f(x,y)&= \frac{1}{x+y}
\end{align*}

* Visualizing functions
Truth be told, while functions with two variables are slightly more difficult
than our /common/ functions in visualization, they can be easily perceived. That
changes when we talk about functions of more variables making it increasingly
more difficult for us to visualize them.[fn:1]

Just like we got used to seeing $y=f(x)$, it is easy, especially if you sit in
front of a computer, to plot a function of two variables by using: $z=f(x,y)$.

Some examples of such plots:
1. $f(x,y)=-y$
   [[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_-y3d.png]]
2. $f(x,y) = 1-x^2-y^2$
   [[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_1.png]]
3. $f(x,y)=y^2-x^2$
   [[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_y2-x23d.png]]
    The first time we see a *saddle point*, in which we will be interested in
   the near future.

** Understanding a three-dimensional plot
It is not necessary however, to use a computer to generate such a plot.
Obviously, it will make our lives significantly easier *and* will ensure a good
result, one that will be presentable and clear to others as well, but it is not
needed.

Even though it gets increasingly more tiring for more complex functions a good
approach to designing the three dimensional plot of a given function $f$, is
taking the common points that it has with different planes ( such as the
$xy,xz,yz$ planes )[fn:2]

** Contour plots:
So far, following the simple path, we built upon what we already knew and
managed to describe /every/ function of two variables in the three dimensional
space. Now let's take a step back.

Think of the difficulty which drawing 3d plots presents. We can not reliably
represent complex 3d shapes on paper. Most of the times it will be extremely
difficult for the reader to understand what exactly we're plotting. That's where
contour plots come in. They are a collection of curves in the form of $f(x,y) =
c\in \mathbb{R}$.

An easy way to understand what contour plots are is by looking at an ordinary
map ( such as the one below ), and look how height is embedded in it.
Interesting is not it[fn:3]?

*** Octave code for simple contour plots:
#+begin_src octave
[x,y] = meshgrid(-10:0.1:10,-10:01.:10)
contour(x.^2+y.^2)
#+end_src

That ( with the slight change of using the ~contourf~ instead of the ~contour~
func ) gives us:
[[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_sampleContour.png]]

*** Contour plots applications
Just like we have already seen, contour plots are often met in mapsThere are many applications in maps, being able to get information on the
location generally:
- Heat maps
- Height maps
- Population maps

*** Examples
Linking to the previous examples, their contour plots:
1. $f(x,y) = -y$
   [[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_-yContour.png]]
2. $f(x,y)= 1-x^2-y^2$
   [[file:../../../images/1802/1802_8_2.png]]
3. $f(x,y)=x^2-y^2$

* Partial Derivatives
Now think of a random contour plot. Just by looking at it we can understand in
just one look how moving on the plane is going to affect our function's values.
More specifically, we can see that if we move *on* a contour plot, our
function's value will remain constant, while in any other case it will increase
or decrease. We can also see ( if we are careful enough ) in which direction the
function increases at a maximum rate.

Thus, we can intuitively understand the rate of change, which we know as the
derivative of a function:

** Remember
For a function of one variable the derivative is given as:
\begin{equation}
f'(x) = \frac{d{f}}{d{x}} = \lim_{\Delta{x}\to 0 }\frac{f(x+\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

*** Differentiability
Obviously, we can not compute the derivative of each and every function. There
are some functions for which the derivative does not exist and that remains true
for functions of more variables. It is good to remember it, yet outside the
scope of this course.

*** Approximation formula
If we know the value of $f,f'$ at a point $x_0$ we can approximate the value of
$f$ at $x$, provided that $x$ is /close/ to $x_0$ using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
f(x)\approx  f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
\end{equation}

#+begin_comment
This also links to Taylor series and Taylor approximation.
#+end_comment


** What changes
The difficulty presented in functions of more variables is that we can change
more than one variable and we can also change both of them in *UNLIMITED* combinations.

We, then, create a new form of a derivative, the *partial derivative*, which
shows us how $f$ would change should we modify only a specific parameter, such
as $x$ or $y$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+\Delta x,y_0)-f(x_0,y_0)}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

*** Geometric implications
It is interesting noting down that partial derivatives can be easily found in 3d
plots as well. Let's pick one of the previous 3d plots and focus on calculating
the partial derivative $\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}$. To do that we only
need to follow this algorithm:
1. Given a 3d plot of our function
2. Draw a plane in the form of $y = y_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$
3. Focus on their intersection
   1. Think of the plane of step 2 as a two dimensional plane and the points
      where it intersects $f$ as the plot of a single variable function $g$
   2. In this two-dimensional graph we see that $y = g(x)$
   3. For every $x\in D_g \subset \mathbb{R}$ it is true that $\frac{d{g}}{d{x}}
      = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} (x,y_0)$

*** Computing partial derivatives
Just like normal derivatives we won't rely on limits to compute them. The rules
we know are applicable to partial derivatives as well, we just need to slightly
change them for a multi-dimensional space.

Using what we already know we can compute a partial derivative by considering
every other variable as a constant. An example follows:
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) &= x + y\\
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} &= \frac{\partial{(x+y)}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{d{x+c}}{d{x}} = 1
\end{align*}


* Footnotes

[fn:3] Think of it like that: $height = f(x,y)$, which essentially translates
that every contour plot on the map shows a level of constant height: $height = c
\in \mathbb{R}$

[fn:2] Afterall, this is how the computer draws the graphs. We may not have the
raw computational power but... we know the algorithm

[fn:1] Of course, one could argue that with the help of computers we could
implement a plotting solution for functions with 3 variables by including the
/time/ factor there. It certainly seems like a good idea to try.
