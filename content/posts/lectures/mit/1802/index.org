* Lectures
Lectures in this course are split in 4 parts.

** Vectors and Matrices
/I will probably never add notes from this part because I do not intend to watch
it again/

** Partial Derivatives

** Double integrals and line integrals in the plane
** Triple integrals and surface integrals in 3-space
