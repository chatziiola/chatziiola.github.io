* Courses I would like to check in the future
Obviously, I am not an undergrad @MIT. The numbering has to do with the science
field /and maybe the department involved/, but since these do not really matter to
me, I have listed them here in my own grouping.
** Computer Science
- [-] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY][6.006]] - Introduction to Algorithms
- [-] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7540DEDD482705B][6.042J]] - Maths for CS
- [ ] 6.034, by Prof. Winston P.
- [ ] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP62QumaaZtCCjkID-NgqrleA][6.SO95]] - Programming for the puzzled.
- [ ] [[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/lecture-videos/][6.172]] - Performance Engineering Of Software Systems
** Mathematics
- [-] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38][18.02]] - Auroux's Multivariable Calculus
  - I loved these lectures, and learnt a lot through them. They are listed here
    because I did not finish them, and since they are entertaining, I'd like to
    do that some time in the future.
- [ ] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEC88901EBADDD980][18.03]] - Differential Equations
- [-] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D][18.06]] - Strang's Linear Algebra
  - To be frank I think I have not seen just a lecture or two, but I feel it is
    by far the best resource to study LA from, and I would really like to gain a
    better understanding of the subject at hand by going through Strang's book
    and exercises at the same time.

** Physics
- [ ] [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro2314mKyUiOILaOC2hk6Pc3j][8.02X]] - Because... Walter Lewin.
