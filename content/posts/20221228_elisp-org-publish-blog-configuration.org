Before getting in greater depth: Huge thanks to an extraordinary member of the
Emacs community, whose (live) videos on YouTube, greatly helped me when I
decided to... turn evil: David Wilson of [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/][System Crafters]]

In fact, this configuration is fully based on the one he presented on his
YouTube [[https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][channel]].

* ACTION ADD Notes for the /beginning/

#+begin_src elisp
;; build-site.el -- Summary
;;; This is a configuration file for emacs to produce html code for my personal
;;; website from plain org mode files. To achieve this I utilize the included
;;; `ox-publish' package as well as `htmlize' (even though I can not understand
;;; why it does not behave as I would like it to ) and parts of
;;; `org-static-blog'

;;; WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. The elisp file should not be edited. Visit
;;; 20221228_elisp-org-publish-blog-configuration.org instead

;;; Commentary:
;;;; TODO Someday I will write something here. Till then ;)

;;; Code:
;;;; Only to stop flycheck

* Getting the gist                                                 :INACTIVE:
This is a literate configuration file, setting up and emacs instance to be run
on a simple virtual machine (Github actions). As such, you will not see most of
the options one cares for when setting up emacs. If you look at [[https://github.com/chatziiola/chatziiola.github.io][my shell script]],
you can see that I run emacs as /cleanly/ as possible:

#+begin_src bash
emacs -Q --script build-site.el
#+end_src

* Site-wide Variables
In this section of the configuration file I initialize the variables that I use
in the rest of the script. The goal here is to have no hard coded paths and/or
settings, and instead, rely on the modification of predefined variables to
change the behavior of already implemented features.

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar domainname "https://chatziiola.github.io"
  "Self-Descriptive. It is the address for which we build our site")
#+end_src

** Content directories
To keep it simple:
- [ ] Create an image here to explain what is what
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar base-dir "./content/"
  "The content directory.")

(defvar public-dir "./public/"
  "The root directory of our webserver.")

(defvar drafts-dir (concat base-dir "drafts/")
  "To be ignored when publishing.")

(defvar posts-dir (expand-file-name "posts/" base-dir)
  "Subfolder of content where posts lie.")

(defvar posts-public-dir (expand-file-name "posts/" public-dir)
  "The public subfolder in which posts will be published.")

(defvar src-dir "./content/src/"
  "Self-descriptive.")

(defvar src-public-dir "./public/src/"
  "Self-descriptive.")
#+end_src
** CSS
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar css-path "/src/rougier.css"
  "Self-descriptive.")
#+end_src

** Head HTML
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar org-blog-head
  (concat
   "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"" css-path "\" />
    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/src/favicon.ico\">"
    "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\" name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">"
   )
  "Description - BLOG HTML HEAD.")

#+end_src

** Postamble 

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar general-postamble
  "<p class=\"footer\"> Made with Emacs and Org. CSS theme developed by @rougier.</p>"
  "To be used on all pages.")

(defvar comments-postamble
  (concat
   "<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\" data-repo=\"chatziiola/chatziiola.github.io\" data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOGq8p0g\" data-category=\"Announcements\" data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOGq8p0s4COSFW\" data-mapping=\"pathname\" data-reactions-enabled=\"1\" data-emit-metadata=\"0\" data-input-position=\"bottom\" data-theme=\"light\" data-lang=\"en\" data-loading=\"lazy\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" async> </script>"
  "<p class=\"date\"> Originally created on %d </p>"
   general-postamble)
  "Postamble for posts so that giscus comments are enabled.")
#+end_src

* Package Settings
These are pretty basic settings, only required in order for us to call a /clean/
emacs instance. A separate directory for packages is specified in order to not
liter our *actual* Emacs directory.

While one could avoid using extra packages ( as I have tried doing ) and keep it
as simple as possible, it is not smart to reinvent the wheel. If the desired
functionality is provided by a third party package, use it.

#+begin_src elisp
;;Set the package installation directory so that packages aren't stored in the
;; ~/.emacs.d/elpa path.
(require 'package)
(setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "./.packages"))
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

;; Initialize the package system
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))

;; Install dependencies
(package-install 'htmlize)
#+end_src

Loading emacs does not mean that the publishing functions and variables have
already been loaded. The following line ensures that.
#+begin_src elisp
;; Load the publishing system
(require 'ox-publish)
#+end_src

* Org To Html Settings
These are settings that are used during the conversion of my org files
(articles) to html files. Under certain circumstances they can be overwritten
from the ~org-projects-alist~' options.

#+begin_src elisp
;; Customize the HTML output
(setq org-html-validation-link t            ;; Don't show validation link
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil       ;; Use our own scripts
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil ;; Use our own styles
      org-html-indent nil
      org-html-self-link-headlines t
      org-export-with-tags t
      org-export-with-smart-quotes t
      org-html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/src/rougier.css\" />")
#+end_src

* Tips:
One could use relative paths (even though I now (<2023-01-01 Sun>) find some
problems with this approach, as it breaks some stuff when creating index pages),
to ensure that no faulty links exist.

#+begin_export elisp
(setq org-link-file-path-type 'relative)
#+end_export

* Project Alist
Org publishing works with projects, a fancy way to call files and directories.

There are four projects, with different variables and settings:
1. [[*Org-files][Org-files]], all org files in my ~/content~ folder
2. [[*Blog-posts][Blog-posts]], all org files in my ~/content/posts~ folder
3. [[*Images][Images]], images in ~/content/images~
4. [[*Static][Static]], html and css files in ~/content/src~

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list
       #+end_src

*** The Brief
The ~org~ mode files ( the articles ) exist in the ~/contents/~ folder, which is
where I'm working. We want to automate the process of converting these files to
html and moving this web-friendly version to the ~/public~ directory, which is
the root directory of our web server.

To achieve that we first convert all org mode files
*** Summing up
1. Order is crucial, since the export is sequential and the later exports may
   overwrite previous ones.


** Org-files

       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "org-files"
       #+end_src

It contains all files in ~/content/~ except for my draft articles. ( It should
work like that, however drafts are currently being exported... Maybe someone
notices the error here and proposes a solution in the comments )
       #+begin_src elisp
             :base-directory "./content/"
             :exclude "./content/drafts/"
       #+end_src


       #+begin_src elisp
             :recursive t
       #+end_src


Kinda general, the publishing function and where to publish
       #+begin_src elisp
             :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
             :publishing-directory "./public"
       #+end_src

       #+begin_src elisp
             :with-author nil           ;; Don't include author name
             :with-creator nil            ;; Include Emacs and Org versions in footer
             :with-drawers t
             :headline-level 4
       #+end_src

       Table of contents has been taken /offline/ due to the fact that I did not
       like how it looked.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :with-toc nil
       #+end_src


      Section numbers do not work with my ~css~ since it provides numbering.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :section-numbers nil       ;; Don't include section numbers
       #+end_src

       This is a setting that gets overwritten for blog posts but it essentially
       makes the home button to point to the home page of my website and the up
       button to go a directory higher.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :html-link-home "/index.html"
             :html-link-up "../index.html"
       #+end_src

       This could be a rather useful entry, if there was maybe an integration
       with version control so that files would only get published if the had
       been edited. The problem is that it makes all posts have the same date
       and that does not look nice. A better way to deal with this problem is
       the ~#+DATE:~ header at the top of blog posts.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :time-stamp-file nil)
       #+end_src


** Blog-posts
       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "blog-posts"
       #+end_src

       This is crucial.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :base-directory "./content/posts"
             :exclude ".*index.org"
       #+end_src

       Recursive once again
       #+begin_src elisp
             :recursive t
       #+end_src

       Another difference
       #+begin_src elisp
             :html-link-up "./index.html"
             :html-link-home "/index.html"
       #+end_src

Yup, I decided against that
       #+begin_src elisp
             :auto-sitemap t
             :sitemap-filename "sitemap.org"
             :sitemap-title "Sitemap"
             :sitemap-sort-files 'anti-chronologically
             :sitemap-date-format "Published: %a %b %d %Y"
       #+end_src

       #+begin_src elisp
             :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
             :publishing-directory "./public/posts"
       #+end_src
Comments
       #+begin_src elisp
             :html-postamble "<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\" data-repo=\"chatziiola/chatziiola.github.io\" data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOGq8p0g\" data-category=\"Announcements\" data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOGq8p0s4COSFW\" data-mapping=\"pathname\" data-reactions-enabled=\"1\" data-emit-metadata=\"0\" data-input-position=\"bottom\" data-theme=\"light\" data-lang=\"en\" data-loading=\"lazy\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" async> </script>"
       #+end_src

The following settings actually do not need further explanation
       #+begin_src elisp
             :with-author t           ;; Don't include author name
             :with-creator t            ;; Include Emacs and Org versions in footer
             :with-drawers t
             :headline-level 4
             :with-toc t                ;; Include a table of contents
             :section-numbers nil       ;; Don't include section numbers
             :time-stamp-file nil)
       #+end_src

** Images
You may have already noticed that the two previous projects contain only my org
files, even though a website is so much more than html ( to which org will get
converted ). There are other types of media, such as images and css elements. In
order to get these published ( contained in ~/content/images~ and ~/content/src~
respectively) we use the ~org-publish-attachment~ function, which essentially
copies the specified files to the target directory

       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "images"
        :base-directory "./content/images"
         :base-extension ".*"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-directory "./public/images"
         :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment)
       #+end_src

** Static
       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "static"
        :base-directory "./content/src"
         :base-extension "html\\|css"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-directory "./public/src"
         :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment)
       )
      )
#+end_src

* The End - Taking Action
#+begin_src elisp
;; Generate the site output
(org-publish-all t)
;(org-static-blog-assemble-index)

(message "Build complete!")
#+end_src
