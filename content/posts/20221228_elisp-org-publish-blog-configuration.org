Before getting in greater depth: Huge thanks to an extraordinary member of the
Emacs community, whose (live) videos on YouTube, greatly helped me when I
decided to... turn evil: David Wilson of [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/][System Crafters]]

In fact, this configuration is fully based on the one he presented on his
YouTube [[https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][channel]].

#+begin_src elisp
;; build-site.el -- Summary

;;; WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. The elisp file should not be edited. Visit
;;; content/posts/20221228_elisp-org-publish-blog-configuration.org instead

;;; This is a configuration file for emacs to produce html code for my personal
;;; website from plain org mode files. To achieve this I utilize the included
;;; `ox-publish' package as well as `htmlize' (even though I can not understand
;;; why it does not behave as I would like it to ) and parts of
;;; `org-static-blog'

;;; WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. The elisp file should not be edited. Visit
;;; 20221228_elisp-org-publish-blog-configuration.org instead
;;; Yup, it is needed twice to make sure I'll read it.

;;; Commentary:
;;;; TODO Someday I will write something here. Till then ;)


;;;; I changed/restructured quite some stuff after having a look at:
;;;; https://her.esy.fun/posts/0001-new-blog/index.html

;;; Code:
;;;; Only to stop flycheck 

#+end_src


* Getting the gist
This is a literate configuration file, setting up and emacs instance to be run
on a simple virtual machine (Github actions). As such, you will not see most of
the options one cares for when setting up emacs. If you look at [[https://github.com/chatziiola/chatziiola.github.io][my shell script]],
you can see that I run emacs as /cleanly/ as possible:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
emacs -Q --script build-site.el
#+end_src

* Site-wide Variables
In this section of the configuration file I initialize the variables that I use
in the rest of the script. The goal here is to have no hard coded paths and/or
settings, and instead, rely on the modification of predefined variables to
change the behavior of already implemented features.

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar domainname "https://blog.chatziiola.live"
  "Self-Descriptive. It is the address for which we build our site")
#+end_src

** Content directories
To keep it simple:
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar base-dir "./content/"
  "The content directory.")

(defvar public-dir "./public/"
  "The root directory of our webserver.")

(defvar drafts-dir (concat base-dir "drafts/")
  "To be ignored when publishing.")

(defvar posts-dir (expand-file-name "posts/" base-dir)
  "Subfolder of content where posts lie.")

(defvar posts-public-dir (expand-file-name "posts/" public-dir)
  "The public subfolder in which posts will be published.")

(defvar src-dir "./content/src/"
  "Self-descriptive.")

(defvar src-public-dir "./public/src/"
  "Self-descriptive.")
#+end_src
** CSS Path
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar css-path "/src/rougier.css"
  "Self-descriptive.")
#+end_src

** Head HTML
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar org-blog-head
  (concat
   "<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">"
   "<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Sans&display=swap\"rel=\"stylesheet\">"
   "<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Condensed&display=swap\"rel=\"stylesheet\">"
   "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"" css-path "\" />
    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/src/favicon.ico\">"
   "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\" name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">"
   )
  "Description - BLOG HTML HEAD.")
#+end_src

** Postamble 
#+begin_src elisp

(defvar general-postamble
  "<p class=\"footer\"> Made with Emacs and Org.<br>CSS theme based on the one developed by <a href=\"https://github.com/rougier\">@rougier</a>.</p>"
  "To be used on all pages.")

(defvar comments-postamble
  (concat
   "<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\" data-repo=\"chatziiola/chatziiola.github.io\" data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOGq8p0g\" data-category=\"Announcements\" data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOGq8p0s4COSFW\" data-mapping=\"pathname\" data-reactions-enabled=\"1\" data-emit-metadata=\"0\" data-input-position=\"bottom\" data-theme=\"light\" data-lang=\"en\" data-loading=\"lazy\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" async> </script>"
   "<p class=\"date footer\"> Originally created on %d </p>"
   general-postamble)
  "Postamble for posts so that giscus comments are enabled.")

#+end_src

** Org-static-blog index variables
Being the person that I am, striving for simplicity and creating chaos to get
there, I have taken parts of this wonderful package [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog][org-static-blog]], and
butchered it to my needs

#+begin_src elisp

;;;; These were set up on a need-to-set basis
(setq org-static-blog-enable-tags t)
(setq org-static-blog-index-file "recents.html")
(setq org-static-blog-index-front-matter "")
(setq org-static-blog-index-length 50)
(setq org-static-blog-posts-directory "./content/posts/")
(setq org-static-blog-page-postamble general-postamble)
(setq org-static-blog-publish-directory "./public/posts/")
(setq org-static-blog-publish-title "Recent Articles")
(setq org-static-blog-publish-url "https://chatziiola.github.io")

#+end_src
* Package Settings :restructure:
These are pretty basic settings, only required in order for us to call a /clean/
emacs instance. A separate directory for packages is specified in order to not
liter our *actual* Emacs directory.

While one could avoid using extra packages ( as I have tried doing ) and keep it
as simple as possible, it is not smart to reinvent the wheel. If the desired
functionality is provided by a third party package, use it.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq make-backup-files nil
      auto-save-default nil
      create-lockfiles nil)

#+end_src


#+begin_src elisp

(require 'package)
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
			 ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

(setq user-emacs-directory (expand-file-name "./.packages"))
(setq package-user-dir user-emacs-directory)

;;; Initialize the package system
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))

#+end_src

Loading emacs does not mean that the publishing functions and variables have
already been loaded. The following lines ensures that we have successfully
loaded the actual publishing system
#+begin_src elisp

;; Load the publishing system
(require 'ox-publish)
(require 'ox-html)
(require 'cl-extra)

#+end_src

Installing ~use-package~
#+begin_src elisp
;; Install dependencies
;; htmlize is needed for proper code formatting:
;; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24082430/org-mode-no-syntax-highlighting-in-exported-html-page
(eval-when-compile
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "use-package" default-directory))
  (require 'use-package))

(use-package htmlize)
#+end_src
* Org To Html Settings
These are settings that are used during the conversion of my org files
(articles) to html files. Under certain circumstances they can be overwritten
from the ~org-projects-alist~' options.


#+begin_src elisp

(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
(setq org-html-htmlize-output-type 'css)

(setq org-src-fontify-natively t		; Fontify code in code blocks.
      org-adapt-indentation nil			; Adaptive indentation
      org-src-tab-acts-natively t		; Tab acts as in source editing
      org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil		; No confirmation before executing code
      org-edit-src-content-indentation 2	; No relative indentation for code blocks
      org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line t) ; Fontify whole block


;; Customize the HTML output
(setq org-html-validation-link nil
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil
      org-html-indent nil
      org-html-self-link-headlines t
      org-export-with-tags t
      org-export-with-smart-quotes t
      org-html-head org-blog-head)
#+end_src

* Babel
Babel-related settings. I'm pretty sure I had this enabled for a fancier feature
than simply highlighting but I'm not 100% sure.

#+begin_src elisp

(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . t)
   (gnuplot . t)
   (haskell . nil)
   (latex . t)
   (octave . t)
   (python . t)
   (matlab . t)
   (shell . t)
   (ruby . t)
   (sql . nil)
   (sqlite . t)))
#+end_src

* Series next/before links :INACTIVE:
This is a functionality that I long wanted to have implemented.  Now, although
this works perfectly, it creates a restriction: The files are chronologically
inserted in the previous/next "queue". This means that in the case of lectures,
which I have irregularly published at times, there may be a slight confusion. To
avoid this causing a problem we must be careful with the dates in the filenames
of /forced/ lectures.

#+NAME: Previous/Next links and buttons on lectures.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-find-next-previous-series-article (file)
  "Find the filenames of the next and previous article, if they exist, in the same directory as FILE.
   This function acts only on lectures (files starting with 'lec_.) as of now.
The filenames are returned in HTML format."
  (when (string-prefix-p "lec_" (file-name-nondirectory file))
    (let* ((dir (file-name-directory file))
	   (name (file-name-nondirectory file))
	   (files (sort (directory-files dir nil "^lec_.*\\.org$") 'string<))
	   (index (cl-position name files :test 'equal)))

	;; This is a hack to ensure that the files get returned with the .html extension
	(let ((prev (if (and (> index 0) (nth (1- index) files))
			     (concat (file-name-sans-extension (nth (1- index) files)) ".html")))
	      (next 
		    (if (and (< index (1- (length files))) (nth (1+ index) files))
			(concat (file-name-sans-extension (nth (1+ index) files)) ".html"))))
	  (cons prev next))))
  )

#+end_src

This function works really well the preceding one yet is not ideal. It inserts
the content at the end of the org mode buffer, causing problems with footnotes,
where they exist.
#+NAME: Using the export-before-parsing to insert the previous/next links inside of the org buffer
#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-add-links-to-next-previous-series-article (backend)
  "Add links to the previous and next series articles, if they exist."
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
    (let ((prev-next (my-find-next-previous-series-article (buffer-file-name))))
      (when prev-next
	(let ((prev (car prev-next))
	      (next (cdr prev-next)))
	  (when (or prev next)
	    (goto-char (point-max))
	    (forward-line 1)
	    (insert "\n#+begin_export html\n")
	    (insert "<div class=\"series-navigation-div\">\n")
	    (when prev (insert (format "<p><a class=\"nav-button previous-nav-button\" href=\"%s\">Previous</a></p>\n" prev)))
	    (when next (insert (format "<p><a class=\"nav-button next-nav-button\" href=\"%s\">Next</a></p>\n" next)))
	    (insert "</div>\n")
	    (insert "#+end_export")))))))

(add-hook 'org-export-before-parsing-hook 'my-add-links-to-next-previous-series-article)
#+end_src


The perfect solution would be one like the preceding, the only problem with this
one is that it no longer works with the find-previous-next algorithm, since we
do not know which html files are created (only the previous one exists, the we
can not add a next button).
#+NAME: Using the export-after-parsing-hook for insertion at the very end.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no

(defun my-add-links-to-next-previous-series-article ()
  "Add links to the previous and next series  articles, if they exist."
  (let ((prev-next (my-find-next-previous-series-article (buffer-file-name))))
    (when prev-next
      (let ((prev (car prev-next))
	    (next (cdr prev-next)))
	(goto-char (point-max))
	(unless (re-search-backward "<div id=\"postamble\"" nil t)
	  (error "Could not find postamble div"))
	(insert "\n<div class=\"series-navigation-div\">\n")
	(when prev (insert (format "<p><a class=\"nav-button previous-nav-button\" href=\"%s\">Previous</a></p>\n" prev)))
	(when next (insert (format "<p><a class=\"nav-button next-nav-button\" href=\"%s\">Next</a></p>\n" next)))
	(insert "</div>\n")
	))))

(add-hook 'org-export-after-parsing-hook #'my-add-links-to-next-previous-series-article)

#+end_src

* Tips:
One could use relative paths (even though I now (<2023-01-01 Sun>) find some
problems with this approach, as it breaks some stuff when creating index pages),
to ensure that no faulty links exist.

#+begin_export elisp
(setq org-link-file-path-type 'relative)
#+end_export

* Project Alist
Org publishing works with projects, a fancy way to call files and directories.

There are four projects, with different variables and settings:
1. [[*Org-files][Org-files]], all org files in my ~/content~ folder
2. [[*Blog-posts][Blog-posts]], all org files in my ~/content/posts~ folder
3. [[*Images][Images]], images in ~/content/images~
4. [[*Static][Static]], html and css files in ~/content/src~

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list
       #+end_src

*** The Brief
The ~org~ mode files ( the articles ) exist in the ~/contents/~ folder, which is
where I'm working. We want to automate the process of converting these files to
html and moving this web-friendly version to the ~/public~ directory, which is
the root directory of our web server.

To achieve that we first convert all org mode files
*** Summing up
1. Order is crucial, since the export is sequential and the later exports may
   overwrite previous ones.

** Org-files

       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "org-files"
       #+end_src

It contains all files in ~/content/~ except for my draft articles. ( It should
work like that, however drafts are currently being exported... Maybe someone
notices the error here and proposes a solution in the comments )
       #+begin_src elisp
	     :base-directory base-dir
	     :base-extension "org"
	     :exclude drafts-dir
       #+end_src


       #+begin_src elisp
             :recursive t
       #+end_src


Kinda general, the publishing function and where to publish
       #+begin_src elisp
       :html-link-home "/index.html"
       :html-link-up "../index.html"
       :html-postamble general-postamble
       :publishing-directory public-dir
       :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
       #+end_src

       #+begin_src elisp
             :with-author nil           ;; Don't include author name
             :with-creator nil            ;; Include Emacs and Org versions in footer
             :with-drawers t
             :headline-level 4
       #+end_src

       Table of contents has been taken /offline/ due to the fact that I did not
       like how it looked.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :with-toc nil
       #+end_src


      Section numbers do not work with my ~css~ since it provides numbering.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :section-numbers nil       ;; Don't include section numbers
       #+end_src

       This is a setting that gets overwritten for blog posts but it essentially
       makes the home button to point to the home page of my website and the up
       button to go a directory higher.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :html-link-home "/index.html"
             :html-link-up "../index.html"
       #+end_src

       This could be a rather useful entry, if there was maybe an integration
       with version control so that files would only get published if the had
       been edited. The problem is that it makes all posts have the same date
       and that does not look nice. A better way to deal with this problem is
       the ~#+DATE:~ header at the top of blog posts.
       #+begin_src elisp
             :time-stamp-file nil)
       #+end_src

** Blog-posts
       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "blog-posts"
       #+end_src

       This is crucial.
       #+begin_src elisp
       :base-directory posts-dir
       :base-extension "org"
       :exclude ".*index.org"
       #+end_src

       Recursive once again
       #+begin_src elisp
             :recursive t
       #+end_src

       Another difference
       #+begin_src elisp
             :html-link-up "./index.html"
             :html-link-home "/index.html"
       #+end_src

Yup, I decided against that
       #+begin_src elisp
        ;     :auto-sitemap t
        ;     :sitemap-filename "sitemap.org"
        ;     :sitemap-title "Sitemap"
        ;     :sitemap-sort-files 'anti-chronologically
        ;     :sitemap-date-format "Published: %a %b %d %Y"
       #+end_src

       #+begin_src elisp
       :html-postamble  comments-postamble
       :publishing-directory posts-public-dir
       :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
       #+end_src

The following settings actually do not need further explanation
       #+begin_src elisp
       :with-author t           ;; Don't include author name
       :with-creator t            ;; Include Emacs and Org versions in footer
       :with-drawers t
       :with-date t
       :headline-level 4
       :with-toc t                ;; Include a table of contents
       :section-numbers nil       ;; Don't include section numbers
       :time-stamp-file nil)
       #+end_src

** Images
You may have already noticed that the two previous projects contain only my org
files, even though a website is so much more than html ( to which org will get
converted ). There are other types of media, such as images and css elements. In
order to get these published ( contained in ~/content/images~ and ~/content/src~
respectively) we use the ~org-publish-attachment~ function, which essentially
copies the specified files to the target directory

       #+begin_src elisp
       (list "Images"
	     :base-directory posts-dir
	     :base-extension "png"
	     :publishing-directory posts-public-dir
	     :publishing-function 'org-blog-publish-attachment
	     :recursive t
	     )
       #+end_src

** Static
#+begin_src elisp
(list "Website static stuff"
      :base-directory src-dir
      :base-extension "html\\|css\\|ico"
      :publishing-directory src-public-dir
      :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment
      :recursive t
      )
)
)



#+end_src

And another function to help with images
#+begin_src elisp
;; Automatic image conversion
(defun org-blog-publish-attachment (plist filename pub-dir)
  "Publish a file with no transformation of any kind.
FILENAME is the filename of the Org file to be published.  PLIST
is the property list for the given project.  PUB-DIR is the
publishing directory.
Take care of minimizing the pictures using imagemagick.
Return output file name."
  (unless (file-directory-p pub-dir)
    (make-directory pub-dir t))
  (or (equal (expand-file-name (file-name-directory filename))
	     (file-name-as-directory (expand-file-name pub-dir)))
      (let ((dst-file (expand-file-name (file-name-nondirectory filename) pub-dir)))
	(if (string-match-p ".*\\.\\(png\\|jpg\\|gif\\)$" filename)
	    (shell-command (format "convert %s -resize 800x800\\> +dither -colors 16 -depth 4 %s" filename dst-file))
	  (copy-file filename dst-file t)))))

       #+end_src

* The End - Taking Action

#+begin_src elisp

(org-publish-all t)

#+end_src

* Org-static-blog for index creation
I tried removing this section, but in great terror I realized how
naive I was when I wrote this. It needs the variables that I set in
here.

#+begin_src elisp

(load (expand-file-name "index-generator.el" default-directory))
(chatziiola/org-static-blog-assemble-index-no-content)

;;; build-site.el ends here.
#+end_src

* Sources of inspiration
This is intended to be the last section of my literate config file. It is
devoted to all the websites that inspired me to take action towards improving my
site:
