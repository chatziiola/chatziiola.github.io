#+title: Wylie, Crawley 2020: The Pentester Bluepring
#+DATE: <2022-03-30 Wed>

Some time ago I bought a /humble book bundle/ on Cybersecurity[fn:1] and it had
SOOOO MANY BOOKS. Seriously, when I learned that this bundle was available I
could not contain myself. Since then I have started reading some of these books,
always driven by the idea "/Read more books to read more/"[fn:2] and constantly
trying to improve my skills.


I had omitted this book and focused on more /practical/ ones, till I saw the
following Shannon Morse thumbnail. That's when I started reading it and... this
is the first book I completed[fn:3].

* Summary
Alright alright alright. The book is excellent.

With that said, it is important to note down that it is not a book that will
teach you a lot of things ( i think that most people reading it will already be
familiar with the terminology used ). The title is really the best description
for how it should be thought of - a blueprint. The authors did such a good job
slecting /training material/, tips, getting interviews from people in the
information security community, that through the book's content a clear path to
a information security career is outlined and presented in an easy-to-read
fashion.

What is left, is up to yourself. Action.

** Book's Contents:
1. What is a Pentester
2. Prerequisite Skills
3. Education of a Hacker
4. Education Resources
5. Building a Pentesting Lab
6. Certifications and Degrees
7. Developing a Plan
8. Gaining Experience
9. Getting Employed as a Pentester

** Tips:
- Every skill, no matter how /technical/, can at times be very useful in
  information security
- Focus on getting the basics down before moving on to more /complex/ terms.
  Generic certification programms such as CompTIA's A+, Security+, Network+ are
  helpful for learning these stuff.
- Read and practice a lot. Building your own lab (and breaking it) and doing
  CTF's are really good ways to get where you want to go
  - You should keep notes on the problems you encounter and on your progress as
    well, so that you can always refer back to them.

* Resources to check:
I thought about this for a very long time, before uploading this article and I
decided that the best I can do for this article to /connect/ with the book would
be to simply have some resources here that anyone can follow[fn:4]:
- [ ] [[https://attack.mitre.org]]
- [ ] CompTIA certifications ( as listed in tips )
- [ ] VulnHub

** Note
If you have ever though of yourselves as /information hoarders/, functioning at
the highest level ( without overloading - that took more than just some time for
me and is still a work in progress ), I really suggest that you buy this book.

* Footnotes
[fn:4] Obviously, they can not be compared with the book itself, they can be
found inside it but are just a tiny part of it.

[fn:3] One could argue that since /I left the last chapter out/ I did not
complete it. However, I just was not interested in that chapter's
no value for me right now. That will inevitably change in the future, and when
it does, I will make sure to read it.

[fn:2] I will most probably one day devote an article to that. I once read an
article that was very beautifully presenting this opinion but I did not have the
system I now have in place, so it got lost among other articles.
