#+description: A review of The Pentester Blueprint: Starting a Career as an Ethical Hacker by Phillip L. Wylie and Kim Crawley. This book serves as a roadmap for aspiring penetration testers, outlining essential skills, education paths, certifications, and hands-on experience needed to break into the field of information security. Rather than teaching technical concepts, it provides guidance, resources, and industry insights to help readers develop a structured approach to becoming a professional pentester.

Some time ago, I bought a /Humble Book Bundle/ on Cybersecurity[fn:1], and it  
included SOOOO MANY BOOKS. Seriously, when I found out about this bundle, I  
couldn't contain myself. Since then, I've started reading some of these books,  
always driven by the idea "/Read more books to read more/"[fn:2] and constantly  
working to improve my skills.  

I initially skipped this book, focusing on more /practical/ ones, until I came  
across the following Shannon Morse thumbnail. That’s when I decided to start  
reading it, and... this is the first book I’ve completed[fn:3].

* Summary  
Alright, alright, alright. The book is excellent.  

That being said, it's important to note that this isn't a book that will teach  
you a lot of new things—most readers will likely already be familiar with the  
terminology used. The title truly captures its essence: it’s a blueprint. The  
authors did a fantastic job selecting /training material/, compiling tips, and  
interviewing professionals in the information security field. Through its  
content, the book clearly outlines a path to a career in information security,  
presented in an easy-to-read manner.  

What happens next is up to you. Action.  

** Book's Contents:  
1. What is a Pentester  
2. Prerequisite Skills  
3. Education of a Hacker  
4. Education Resources  
5. Building a Pentesting Lab  
6. Certifications and Degrees  
7. Developing a Plan  
8. Gaining Experience  
9. Getting Employed as a Pentester  

** Tips:  
- Every skill, no matter how /technical/, can be valuable in information  
  security.  
- Focus on mastering the basics before moving on to more /complex/ topics.  
  General certification programs such as CompTIA's A+, Security+, and Network+  
  are helpful for building this foundation.  
- Read and practice extensively. Setting up and experimenting with your own lab  
  and participating in CTFs are great ways to advance.  
  - Keep notes on the challenges you face and your progress so you can always  
    refer back to them.  

* Resources to check:  
I debated for a long time before publishing this article, and I ultimately  
decided that the best way to /connect/ it with the book would be to list some  
useful resources that anyone can explore[fn:4]:  
- [ ] [[https://attack.mitre.org]]  
- [ ] CompTIA certifications (as mentioned in the tips)  
- [ ] VulnHub  
- [ ] [[https://danielmiessler.com/]]  
  - <2025-01-31 Fri> I have since become a huge fan of his newsletter. 
- [ ] [[https://jhalon.github.io/becoming-a-pentester]]  
- [ ] http://www.porcupine.org/satan/admin-guide-to-cracking.html  
  /The first proper whitepaper on ethical hacking/

** Note  
If you've ever considered yourself an /information hoarder/, striving to  
function at the highest level (without overloading yourself—it took me a long  
time to manage that, and it's still a work in progress), I highly recommend  
getting this book.  

* Footnotes  
[fn:4] Obviously, these resources cannot replace the book itself. They are  
found within it but represent only a small fraction of its content.  

[fn:3] Some might argue that since /I skipped the last chapter/, I didn’t  
technically complete it. However, that chapter isn’t relevant to me at the  
moment. That will inevitably change in the future, and when it does, I’ll make  
sure to read it.  

[fn:2] I will probably devote an article to this idea someday. I once read a  
beautifully written piece on this perspective, but I didn't have my current  
organization system in place, so it got lost among other articles.
