#+TITLE: Exporting Org Mode to LaTeX and PDFs - Multilanguage

#+DESCRIPTION: 
#+FILETAGS: latex

One problem I often encountered when dealing with \LaTeX was the fact that I
could not get the document to be multilingual. More specifically, back in my
~vim~ days, I had a set up tailored to my notetaking ...

I did not like the fact that everything had to be compiled in order for me to
see it though. I like it when I can keep things simple ( KISS ) and that's what
drove me to org mode in the first place (That and GTD to be frank, even though I
have since personalized the whole setup to my needs).

I can now write *everything* in a very /beautiful/ if you ask me and organized
structure, completely inside my editor, have my own functions for automatic
creation and so on, and of course, writing \LaTeX expressions is still
*extremely* easy, if not easier than using snippets through CDLaTeX

So, while installing \LaTeX with all the impressive additions, synching,
realtime exporting and so on, I thought to myself that I do not want to go
through the hassle of writing ~\engbloc{PSPICE}~ every time I need english
characters. [fn:1]

What is needed then?
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-latex-compiler "xelatex")

(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist
             '("AUTO" "polyglossia" t ("xelatex" "lualatex")))
#+end_src

Along with that it is important noting down that these options are useful
#+begin_quote
#+TITLE: <<your title>>
#+DATE: <<a date string>>
#+AUTHOR: <<author's name>
#+LATEX_COMPILER: xelatex
# #+LATEX_CLASS: article 
#+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper,11pt,titlepage]
#+LANGUAGE: el
#+latex_header: \setmainfont{Courier New}
#+end_quote

* Notice
I would not say, however, that org mode can replace plain \LaTeX. That's because it
can not. It is a fact that in order for you to customize your document,  you'll
need to spend much more time in org mode than by simply working in \LaTeX all
along...

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Now, having checked ~xelatex~ for just a little bit of time, it seems
that using ~latexmk~ with babel instead of ~xelatex~ with polyglossia was a huge
error - yet \LaTeX remains more difficult than plain org.
