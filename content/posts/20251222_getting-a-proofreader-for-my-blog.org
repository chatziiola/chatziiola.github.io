#+TITLE: Never Publish a Typo Again: My AI Proofreading Setup
#+DATE: <2025-12-22 13:45>
#+DESCRIPTION: This article explores how I'm using an AI assistant, an LLM, as a proofreader to improve my writing skills as a non-native English speaker and enhance the quality of my blog posts.
#+SUBTITLE: Jarvis, proofread this article!
#+FILETAGS: LLM blog prompt-engineering

* Introduction
Writing an article is an extremely fulfilling process for me. At the same time,
however, I feel uncomfortable publishing something out there: it undermines
(my sense of) security and exposes me to a whole lot of /possible/ problems.

I don't mind criticism, so I'll keep writing, but it got me thinking[fn:1]: Some
problems can be mitigated by simply improving.

* How can this blog be improved?
The list is long but, I could:
1. Design a better website
2. Write better articles
   1. Select topics I'm more qualified to write about
   2. Brush up my English vocabulary (and general usage) to greatly reduce my mistakes
   3. Put more effort in writing
3. Write more articles

#+begin_note
To make a blog better, according to yours truly, is to add more value to it. I
do not aspire to be a blogger - thus I don't care about the number of readers,
but I do care about its quality.
#+end_note

Now, to be frank, I am not willing to spend more time in designing a
better-looking website[fn:3] *but* [2,3] are nice goals. On one hand, writing more
articles will help me improve in the long run. Just the process of expressing my
thoughts and going from scribbled notes to long-form passages will help me:
1. Become more qualified on the topics I'm writing about
2. With my English vocabulary (and general usage)
3. And at the same time, I'll be putting effort into each article
But, in this case [2] is not a guarantee: it is highly likely that writing in
English as a non-native speaker might result in the proliferation of bad
practices. To avoid that, *I need a proofreader*.

* What exactly do I need?
To translate the theoretical /analysis/ of the previous section into tangible goals,
I want someone to work *with* me on:
- Fixing grammar, vocabulary, and syntax mistakes, and helping me learn from them
- Improving readability, perhaps by suggesting better vocabulary
- Performing fact checks[fn:2] and maybe suggesting more targeted research

I'm in no position to hire someone to do this with me. /(Also quite frankly, I'm
not a sadist: I wouldn't want to put anyone through this)/. So... a helper would
be nice

#+begin_note
Just a small note: *This is not about designing a system to mass-produce
articles. This is about designing a system to improve both my writing skills and
my articles*
#+end_note

* Prompt Engineering
All of this is leading up to one thing: *Using an LLM as a proofreader*

## Guidelines for Helping with Draft Articles

When asked to help with a draft article (found in `content/posts`), you will follow these guidelines:

### 1. Fixing Grammar, Vocabulary, and Syntax Mistakes

- You will identify and correct any grammar, vocabulary, or syntax errors in the provided draft.
- For each correction, you will briefly explain the mistake and provide the corrected version, aiming to help you learn and understand the improvement.
- Make sure to also check the footnotes

### 2. Improving Readability and Vocabulary

- You will review the article for clarity, conciseness, and flow.
- You will suggest alternative vocabulary to enhance the article's impact and readability, providing explanations for why the suggested words are better in context.
- You will rephrase sentences or paragraphs for improved structure and logical progression where necessary.

### 3. Performing Fact Checks and Suggesting Targeted Research

- You will perform basic fact-checking on any claims made in the article to ensure accuracy.
- If a claim requires more in-depth verification or if there are gaps in the information, you will suggest targeted research topics or specific areas that need further investigation.
- You will point out any statements that could benefit from supporting evidence or citations.

### 4. Helping with SEO

Finally, after we have concluded the work on previous steps, you will:

- You will offer feedback on the selected `TITLE`. You are encouraged to offer alternatives
- You will generate a proper `DESCRIPTION` for the article, optimized for SEO
- You will add some interesting `FILETAGS`, optimized for SEO
  - You will add up to 5 tags, keep them as closely related to the article as possible
  - Tags must be separated by space (and only space: no commas nor colons)
  - Tags must be written as a single word: longer tags should be converted in a single word by changing spaces into dashes. An example: `prompt engineering` to `prompt-engineering`
- If empty, you will generate a concise yet intriguing `SUBTITLE` for the article

* Footnotes
[fn:2] Now this last one is not fully necessary, but I would appreciate it if I
gradually added citations here; I feel like it is going to help a lot when
reading the articles some months/years from now.

[fn:3] Though I have started fixing the generation process a little bit, which
(should) result in having a better-looking, less bloated website.

[fn:1] Like a true overthinking engineer

[fn:4] "Με ένα σμπάρο δυό τριγώνια." (Me ena sbaro dyo trigonia.) is a Greek idiom meaning "Two turtledoves with one shot," equivalent to the English idiom "to kill two birds with one stone."
