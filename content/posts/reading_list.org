* Introduction
Being an avid reader myself I always like it when I find trustworthy
sources (books, articles, websites) with lists of books to read,
typically accompanied by a small paragraph on why that book merits the
time investment. As such, since I have lately been fortunate to
encounter several impressive books, I decided to create this small
post, which I hope to remember to update periodically.

I have opted against heavy categorization.

* Books
- [Free Online] [[https://www.navalmanack.com/][Almanack of Naval Ravikant]]
- [Free Online] [[https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack][Poor Charlie's Almanack]]

* Blogs / Articles 
- https://two-wrongs.com/ I really like Chris' blog, offering a unique
  look on a plethora of different subjects. Pleasant, yet not always
  relaxed, reading.
