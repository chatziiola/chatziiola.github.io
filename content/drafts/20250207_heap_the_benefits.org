#+begin_note
This article is an attempt to understand and build on heap
exploitation, as a challenge I was given needs such knowledge to be

should consider it just a starting point, and refer to my sources for
a more in-depth understanding of the underlying theory.

1. After learning that [[https://phrack.org/issues/66/10][Phrack]] has an article on the topic, I knew I
   had to take a look at it: [[https://phrack.org/issues/66/10][Malloc Des-Maleficarum]]. Inside it it
   refers to:
   - Vudo Malloc Tricks by MaXX
   - [[https://phrack.org/issues/57/9][Once upon a free()]]
   - [[https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~chris/teaching/papers/heap_jp03.txt][Advanced Doug Lea's malloc exploits]]
   - [[https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/attack/MallocMaleficarum.txt][Malloc Maleficarum]] by Phantasmal Phantasmagoria
   - Phantasmal Phantasmagoria: Exploiting the Wilderness
2. It was also at this point that I was suggested in my feed the
     [[https://infosecwriteups.com/the-toddlers-introduction-to-heap-exploitation-part-1-515b3621e0e8][Toddler's
     introduction to heap exploitation]] series of posts by Ch0pin.
