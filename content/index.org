I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad at [[https://ee.auth.gr/][A.U.Th]].
Always tinkering with new stuff, you will most probably find me
spending my time feeling stuck in many fields and working on others.

Actively working around networks and cybersecurity, while also dealing
with the stress being in that school may introduce into one's life.

Hopefully, there will be time for everything.

I had hoped to just include a gif or something funny but a random xkcd
(as it happens) hit too close to home

I think there are just 3 of his books that I have not read yet, but
(now that I am aware of them) I will probably get started after I
finish "The fellowship of the ring"

** Notes on the site itself.
- +This site is nothing more than a collection of ~org-mode~ files, exported using ~org-publish~ inside of Emacs and hosted by Github Pages.+
  This site, although aesthetically minimal, consists of a plethora of hacks,
  inefficiently implemented ideas, python, bash and elisp scripts, org
  files and some more :P. If you are not afraid of losing your sanity,
  feel free to wonder in the related github repo.
- The code to reproduce the functionality is all open source, however,
  as pointed more formally elsewhere, material published within my
  articles should be considered [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/][CC BY-NC-SA]] licensed, requiring
  attribution.
