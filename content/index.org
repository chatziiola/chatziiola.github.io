* About
My name is Lamprinos Chatziioannou and I am a student at the school of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at A.U.Th. Always tinkering with new stuff, I
find myself spending most of the time feeling stuck in many fields and working
on others. Hopefully, I will find the time to see everything.
