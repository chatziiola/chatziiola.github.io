I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad at [[https://ee.auth.gr/][A.U.Th]].
Always tinkering with new stuff, you will most probably find me
spending my time feeling stuck in many fields and working on others.

Actively working around networks and cybersecurity, while also dealing
with the stress being in that school may introduce into one's life.

Hopefully, there will be time for everything.

** Notes on the site itself.
- This site, despite its minimalist approach, contains a plethora of hacks,  
  inefficiently implemented ideas, Python, Bash, and Elisp scripts, along with  
  various Org files and more :P. If you're not afraid of losing your sanity,  
  feel free to explore the related GitHub repo.  
- The code that reproduces the functionality is entirely open source. However,  
  as stated more formally elsewhere, material published within my articles is  
  licensed under [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/][CC BY-NC-SA]], requiring attribution.
