#+TITLE: Chasing Simplicity

Hello all, this is my personal blog, built using emacs and org mode. Feel free
to browse the repo if you are interested in the source code (it may be in
spaghetti form, but I believe it is unique as far its performance is taken into
consideration), or to visit the web site itself and read its articles.

You can find the link for the web site [[https://chatziiola.github.io][here]]!
