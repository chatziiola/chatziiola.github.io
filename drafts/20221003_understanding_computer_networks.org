Think of every app you use on your computer. Or, better yet, think of your
browser. Here we will take a short trip following the packet that we sent and
the packet that we receive back

Let's suppose that you want to ssh to another machine in your network. You are
in a typical home network of ~192.168.1.1/24~. Your computer has an ip of
~192.168.1.67~ and you want to ssh in ~192.168.1.68~.

- [ ] Explain the network notation

How does it work?

** App Layer
You write on your terminal:
#+begin_src bash
ssh user@192.168.1.68
#+end_src

** TCP Layer

** IP Layer

** Ethernet protocl

1. Opening our browser we head to https://www.google.com
2. The thing is we do not know who www.google.com is
   1. That's why we need to ask the dns server.
   2. Falling down the dns rabbit hole
3. Ok now we know that www.google.com is 8.8.8.8. What is next?
4. Sending a tcp ip packet to 8.8.8.8
5. Arriving at our local router

* The bigger picture

** The OSI Model 

Each layer has specified traits/characteristics even though the *implementation*
may have slightly changed throughout the years

  
|-------+---------------------+-------------|
| Layer |                     | Description |
|-------+---------------------+-------------|
|     7 | Application         |             |
|     6 | Presentation        |             |
|     5 | Session             |             |
|     4 | Transport Layer     |             |
|     3 | Network Layer       |             |
|     2 | Data Link Layer     |             |

  The OSI Network Model can be thought of as a theoretical, ideal way of
  implementing the network. However, as it happens in many cases, the practice
  differs from theory. Most of the Internet is actually built using the TCP/IP
  Stack.

** The TCP/IP Stack
According to [cite:@nemethUNIXLinuxSystem2018], TCP/IP is /the networking system
that underlies the Internet/
