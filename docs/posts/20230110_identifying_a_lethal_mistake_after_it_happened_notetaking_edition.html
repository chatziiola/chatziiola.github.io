For a while now I use my own implementation of a <i>notetaking</i> system to quickly
and efficiently create lecture notes, ready to be published, exported and
reviewed. All within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
This solution worked perfectly and I took huge pride in it. It allowed me to
focus on the lecture, utilizing only muscle memory to jot what was being taught
down and, since my touch-typing skills are on point, ensuring that I would have
quality material I could later study from.
</p>

<p>
It really worked.
Until it failed.
</p>

<p>
And today it failed again.

While writing the draft for this article I realized that this might have never
happened if I had published my configuration earlier. Anyone seeing the code
(even though I&rsquo;m not proud of its quality), might have seen this mistake&#x2026;
Moral of the story: I should write about my notetaking setup, detailing the
faulty parts and asking for criticism maybe&#x2026;
</p>

</div>

<p>
Sometime this Fall Semester (on a Monday), I was at my university, attending a
lecture on Stochastic Signals (you can see more about the course <a href="lectures/auth/ssd/index.html">here</a>) when
suddenly my working file was corrupted and I lost everything I had written
till that point. Even my automatically generated backup files (which I had kept
active in my configuration for moments like these) could not help me. Something
mysterious had happened.
</p>

<p>
I could not understand what, but since the lecture was still going, I focused on
writing down what was left of it. Later, when it was over, I added as much as I
could remember, completing it (even though its quality could not be compared to
the original one).
</p>

<p>
Since I believed it was my error, I did not waste any time into trying to see
what went on. After all, the file was not corrupted in a way I could understand:
an empty file was just written on top of it, giving me the blank template I have
before adding content to a lecture.
</p>

<p>
Today, as I was watching Strang&rsquo;s wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZnhQjJu4I&amp;ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare">lecture on eigenvalues and
eigenvectors</a>, I stopped to go back to a previous one: I had forgotten how to
calculate the null space. I decided to create a reference for that lecture as
well, to avoid spending more time in the future to revisit the lecture: I can
visit my notes in a much more timely fashion. However, instead of visiting a new
file I &#x2026; lost my lecture notes at the blink of an eye.
</p>

<p>
And that is when I saw how naive I was when I wrote this little part of the code.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org524b056" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org524b056"><a href="#org524b056">The Doombringer</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org524b056">
<p>
This is the function that I had originally created (and used till this day)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun chatziiola/set-lectures-filename(course)
  "Returns the lecture's title in a format: lec_&lt;course&gt;_&lt;date&gt;.org"
  (concat "lec_" course  "_" (format-time-string "%Y%m%d"(current-time)) ".org"))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The description was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Set the lecture&rsquo;s filename. I have experimented for a long time with this
function but i think that the &rsquo;lec_&lt;course&gt;_&lt;date&gt;.org&rsquo; is an ideal format.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you did not see what became so painfully apparent to me today: I do not check
whether this file exists (nor does the function the calls this one). I just
assume&#x2026; a lot of things.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2253d2d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2253d2d"><a href="#org2253d2d">Understanding my mistake</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2253d2d">
<p>
Back when I created this function I hoped my files would get named like that :
 <code>lec_course_lecnumber_title.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
The thought that the <code>title</code> was unknown at the beginning of the lecture (at least
for the non-recorded ones) had not come to my mind and the <code>lecnumber</code>
implementation was equally problematic: I did not want to spend any more time in
designing the script, I wanted it to be functional and use it. However, my
implementations of <code>lecnumber</code> were at that point unacceptable, forcing me to
settle on a much simpler format: <code>lec_course_simpledate.org</code>
</p>

<p>
The only drawback with this format would be apparent only when I manually
visited the lectures directory, which was more than acceptable since I would
solely visit these files through my set of custom functions. Furthermore, since
my lecture files are plain-text even a simple bash snippet such as this one
could do the job:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">for i in lec_SSD*; do echo $i; head -10 $i | grep 'TITLE'; done 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Additionally, I just that only one lecture per course would be created per day,
so it is completely unnecessary to implement checks, or add more information in
the file title to separate lecture files it from each other. After all, I wanted
to keep it minimal.
</p>

<div class="note" id="orgc8f5242">
<p>
<b>Free tip:</b> When you reach a point, even in scripts as simple as my notetaking
ones, where you can spend 5 minutes implementing a check, please do it, no
matter how silly it feels at the moment. I had it as a rule for myself, but
thought that, in this occasion, I could do without it. Look at me now: Writing
this article, after losing my notes.
</p>

</div>

<p>
It all becomes clear now: I either need to make it impossible for a lecture to
have the same filename as another lecture <b>or</b> to make sure that I check whether
the file exists.

I will keep the second one, mainly because of the fact that rarely will I need
the extra information that exists on the filename.

<p>
If anyone has a better solution though, I am always open to suggestions.
