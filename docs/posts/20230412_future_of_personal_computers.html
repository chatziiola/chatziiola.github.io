I was just thinking how strange our times are. Everything is so
rapidly changing and what seems only logical to happen next feels like
an absurdity of our imagination. For example &#x2026; computers.
</p>

<p>
We have gotten used to having a computer next to us to work on, but it
often is a mere illusion: even at the moment of writing, many people
work on remote computers.
</p>

<p>
If it is already happening, what am I thinking of? Simply the extend
to which this can dominate personal computing.
</p>

<p>
As someone that has gone far and wide (unfortunately) numerous times
to create  his ideal working environment, I am deeply intrigued by the
potential effect that the high QoS in modern networking may have in
personal (and professional) computing. Make something once, and always
work on it: No more searching for files between computers. No more,
having a cloud service to sync your files between different computers.
No more setting your applications up on each one. No more, no more.
</p>

<p>
<i>Going back to a mainframe model</i>, one may opt to always connect to a
specific machine (it does not even need to be physical - obviously),
from all of their devices. There are some technical difficulties and
lots of security challenges, but undoubtedly, we&rsquo;re heading that way.
</p>

<p>
Just like NVIDIA, and other companies I may not be aware of, tried
with gaming: to have a base-level device streaming high quality
content through the Internet, allowing the users to overcome the
limitations of their handheld device, this can happen one a much
larger scale.
</p>

<p>
After all, this could be revolutionizing, slashing the need to have
many highly capable devices, but replacing those with (barely
functional - compared to the high end ones I suppose) ones that only
serve as the monitor and the other peripherals.
</p>

<p>
However, obviously danger is around the corner (&ldquo;μηδέν καλόν αμιγές
κακού&rdquo;).

<p>
This last disadvantage, the dystopic thought that made me think of
this <i>mainframe</i> model, is from my point of view, rather crucial.
Especially since everything around us seems to be moving at the speed
of light towards a subscription based / own-nothing model.
</p>

<p>
Although the advantages are by no means insignificant, it is vital
that the subscription model does not eliminate <i>traditional</i> computing.
I can only imagine the freedom of speech, privacy, availability,
financial and so on concerns of <b>having to depend</b> on a
(not-always-trusty) third party to host your computer.
</p>

<p>
I may develop on the inherent dangers of the domination of the
subscription based model to the world. The lack of regulation and talk
around it is troubling.
