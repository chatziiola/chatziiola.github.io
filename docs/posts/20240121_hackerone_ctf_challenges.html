Hello World! Long time no see! After taking a break from writing, to
focus on the rest of my responsibilities and tasks, I&rsquo;m back with
another small walkthrough on my latest set of mini cybersec challenges.
</p>

<p>
Having canceled my THM subscription<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, I went back to my ebook
library, to start ticking off some more books from those included in
my <i>carefully picked</i> humble bundles. I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bug-Bounty-Bootcamp-Reporting-Vulnerabilities-ebook/dp/B08YK368Y3">Li&rsquo;s Bug Bounty
Bootcamp</a>. It has been incredible so far and (maybe due to the
twisted way my mind works :P) inspiring.
</p>

<p>
It made me want to put some effort in what could be considered my
weakest aspect in cyber security testing, web security. I intend to
focus on this field for the next couple of months, building a solid
foundation so that I can later use these skills more widely. Along
with the book, I decided to get practical, creating a HackerOne
account, and doing some <a href="https://ctf.hacker101.com/">Hacker101</a> challenges. Here is one of those I
have since completed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d5b961" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2d5b961"><a href="#org2d5b961">Testing</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2d5b961">
<p>
Heading to the website we can see that there are some pre-existing
articles, and we can freely create some ourselves. Since it was (is?)
the first time I am using my own set up and not some preconfigured
distro/complete installation to practice Web Recon (and exploitation),
I decided to make it harder: not only by limiting the tools to those
already installed (namely a proper burp suite community installation,
along with my programming setup), but also by using python to automate
any tasks I wanted to automate.
</p>

<p>
Brushing up python can not possibly hurt.
</p>



<div class="note" id="org417349b">
<p>
This definitely should not be listed as a fuzzer but, well.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Seeing that the (first) article I created had an <i>id</i> of 8 (thus
existed in <code>/page/8</code>) without that many articles being apparent, I
thought it might be interesting to check for other <i>ids</i>.
Instead of doing that with an already-existing fuzzer, I shall do it in python
(and literate programming for that matter :P):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check all pages from 1 to 10, paying attention to the status codes
to see if they existed</li>
</ul>




<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python" id="orgd263ade"># Snippet to open all pages in my browser
# Verdict: Inefficient and illogical, I only want to get the interesting pages
import webbrowser

for article in range(1,10):
    webbrowser.open('placeholder-link' +str(article))

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or, in a more convenient manner, allowing for our requests to be
stored within Burp Suite as well: 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python" id="org8e1fde4"># Snippet to open all pages virtually in python, utilizing burp at the same time
# Verdict: The way to go, quickly getting the results I want without messing with GUI

import requests

result = []
proxy={'https': '127.0.0.1:8080'}
mylink='placeholder' # For easier modification

for article in range(1,10):
    try:
        resp = requests.get(mylink+str(article),
                            verify=False, # Avoid self-signed certificate errors
                            proxies=proxy,
                            allow_redirects=True,)
        if resp.status_code != 404:
            # We do not care about 404s
            result.append(f"Intersting! {resp.status_code}: Article {article}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        return("Noice:", e)

return result
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example" id="org39afb88">
#+RESULTS: Smarter Implementation
| Intersting! 200: Article 1\n | Intersting! 200: Article 2\n | Intersting! 403: Article 6\n | Intersting! 200: Article 8\n |
</pre>

<p>
The code itself is not spectacular (in fact I could not even write its
output without making a spelling mistake one might notice), but allows
us to witness an abnormality: <b>Post 6 gives us 403: forbidden</b>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgaddfec2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgaddfec2"><a href="#orgaddfec2">XSS</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaddfec2">
<p>
My first thought, seeing a lot of input fields was to check for
self-XSS on what was already available to me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On a new post&rsquo;s title</li>
<li>On a new post&rsquo;s contents</li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting an <code>alert(1)</code> inside the title, simple enough, rewards us with a
flag. No check is present there, unlike the contents box, where script
gets substituted with scrubbed, not allowing the code to run without
some evasion trick. Luckily, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheatsheet</a>
has some tricks we can use, getting the another flag.
</p>

<p>
At this point we have flags 2,3, searching for 1,2.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;IMG SRC=/ onerror="alert(1)"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-org19abc4b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org19abc4b"><a href="#org19abc4b">Getting access to the forbidden file</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org19abc4b">
<p>
I was so sure that the answer to bypassing the 403 there would be
something extremely silly&#x2026; and it was :P. Just heading to the
respective <code>/edit</code> page and we can get what we want. Now flag 2 is all we
want to <i>wrap</i> this mini challenge.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8c01765" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8c01765"><a href="#org8c01765">Not-so-good SQLi</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c01765">
<p>
This bothered me a lot, not knowing where to look and what to pay
attention to. After feeling like I was hitting my head against a wall
for more than 20 minutes, I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHPuW5NU2wk">Tib3rius</a> video on the room, in which
even though this flag is not revealed, I got a great idea on how to go
looking for it: SQL injection on the different pages. It worked on the
first I tried.
</p>


<p>
May seem silly, but for some reason I had not given this possibility a
thought till that moment&#x2026; Will do from now on.
