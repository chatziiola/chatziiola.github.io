God, do I miss the non-exam period.

You know, we are often in the position of having to perform tedious tasks
repeatedly, yet fearing that by trying to automate we will lose more time, we&#x2026;
do the boring stuff.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook</i>, the authors suggest that
sysadmins do not fall into the trap of believing that automation is only for big
projects and that it requires elaborate planning.
</p>

Thinking of that section of the book, today, after not being able to sleep as
well as I&rsquo;d like the previous day, I gave this a shot. To my surprise, not only
did it work, but it was also (if I remember correctly) way more efficient, than
if I had done that by hand.

The script is as simple as it gets, I just needed to replace a
property that was wrongly set in my notes. The fact that it is less
than 10 lines, is a consequence of the library of small scripts and
functions, which even though they may not be beautifully written, have
tremendous practical value.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">
(<span class="org-keyword">cl-loop</span> for file in (chatziiola/get-lecture-file-list <span class="org-string">"CCNA"</span>) do
         (message <span class="org-string">"Starting %s"</span> file)
         (<span class="org-keyword">with-current-buffer</span> (get-file-buffer file)
           (message <span class="org-string">"Inside the file"</span>)
           (goto-char (point-min))
           (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (search-forward <span class="org-string">"A.U.Th"</span> nil t)
            (replace-match <span class="org-string">"CISCO"</span>)
            (message <span class="org-string">"Un-Successful search"</span>))

         )

In fact, with just a slight modification, this can turn into a function,
allowing me to use it in the future without losing time re-implementing it,
effectively solving the same <i>problem</i> again.

<span class="org-doc">is not set, replace current value with the default one"</span>

           (<span class="org-keyword">with-current-buffer</span> (get-file-buffer file)
             (goto-char (point-min))

                 (replace-match (chatziiola/get-lecture-institution course))
               (message <span class="org-string">"Un-Successful search in file: %s"</span> file)))

I have to make a couple of points here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>You do not always save time by writing a script.</b> You have to pick your
battles. If writing the script is sure to take some time and will not be used
often, making it hard to <i>get your time back</i>, it probably is a good idea to
deal with it manually. No one wants that but <i><b>sigh</b></i> time is limited</li>
<li><b>You can always win something by writing a script.</b> That <i>something</i> most of the
times is experience, which you will take advantage of when found in similar
situations. (This is more or less what I tell myself when a script took more
time than I had anticipated :P)</li>
<li><b>Use the right tool for the job - utilize existing infrastructure.</b> Once again,
the script above is rather simple, and I had opened a python file to write it
in, when I realized that writing it in elisp would most probably be a little
bit better for me, since I have some functions I could use. That decision
saved me some time. Imagine how much time one could save with an equivalent
decision in a much more complicated script.</li>
<li><b>Organize your scripts properly</b>. If they are not small functions that can be
grouped together, consider bundling them all by topic or by programming
language and creating a catalog, with a small description for each one.
Ironically this, usually, is the kind of job that we tried to avoid in the
first place, but in the long run it is definitely worth it.</li>
</ol>

Summing up, the thing is, that <i>Rome was not built in a day</i>. From my experience,
one needs to start building their script arsenal, keeping track of the problems
they have solved and in time, they will find that being able to utilize previous
work saves them much time.
