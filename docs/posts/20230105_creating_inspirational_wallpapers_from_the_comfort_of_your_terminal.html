The first two months of the year are always somewhat difficult if you are an
undergraduate in Greece, since the final exams of the Fall Semester take place
and&#x2026; you have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6JRD-ubxR4&amp;ab_channel=asasyn151">ruuuuuuun</a>. Yet, we must press on, no matter how easily one may
feel demotivated.
</p>

<p>
What I, personally, find most difficult, is taking a step back and relaxing. No
matter how many hours I put in, or how I push myself, university exams for some
reason mess with my well being. It most probably is a direct result of the first
year being through Zoom calls, making it difficult to participate and cultivate
a genuine interest in my courses. I&rsquo;m working on it.
</p>

<p>
Since I spend most of my time studying on my computer (a process which I would I
will explore in a later post), I decided to create some inspirational
wallpapers.
</p>

<p>
Not so obviously, a graphical interface will not be necessary for this task.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Make sure that you have the proper package installed
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt install imagemagick # Good ol' linux
brew install imagemagick     # Well, what can I say here
</pre>
</div></li>
<li>Find the images you want. Ideally
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High resolution. I had a major problem here and this is the main reason I&rsquo;m
posting today. I may need to come back here when I eventually spend some
more time to find quality pictures</li>
<li>I like the black and white style due to minimalism and simplicity</li>
<li>You may want to use google dorking, even though it was not really helpful
in the end</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find the quotes you want
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try using smaller quotes</li>
<li>If you settle on quotes that you see that exceed the boundaries of your
image use &ldquo;\n&rdquo; to break the quote in lines</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Copy the following command to your terminal
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">convert &lt;input image&gt; -font Iosevka -pointsize 24 -gravity Center -interline-spacing 26 -fill white -annotate 0 "&lt;quote&gt;" &lt;output image&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Explaining the options used here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>&lt;input image&gt;</code> self-descriptive</li>
<li><code>-font</code> self-descriptive</li>
<li><code>-pointsize</code> the size of the letters of your font</li>
<li><code>-gravity</code> the location in which the text will be placed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Center, South, West, North, East</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>-interline-spacing</code>, the space between the lines</li>
<li><code>-fill</code>, font color</li>
<li><code>-annotate</code>, essentially the function we want to perform: adding the quote
on top of the image</li>
<li><code>&lt;output image&gt;</code>
There are some other options I have explored yet did not work the way I</li>
</ul>
<p>
wanted:
</p></li>
<li><code>-warp</code>, not supported by my <code>magick</code> version, even though it should be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>-split</code>, It inserts a solid color part in the image, effectively ruining the
images we have selected in 2.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then, for every image:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Substitute input, output and quote. Following the tips in quotes above may
be necessary to customize your output wallpapers</li>
<li>If you are kind lazy and want to put many quotes on the same images you
could modify what</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s done.</li>
</ol>

Also, <b>DISCLAIMER</b>:
I have found most of these quotes online on goodreads or elsewhere. They may or
may not have been said by the people I attribute them to. Even if they were not,
their purpose to me is inspiration and hopefully, getting some wisdom out of them.
