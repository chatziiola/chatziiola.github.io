A long and happy life is always the goal. But if you had to choose between one
of them, what would it be?
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s what I caught myself thinking while reading Ikigai(TODO add link)
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Is happiness always simply defined?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Could easily be happy just spending time with my friends and family, having
tea and reading books. I know I would like that, because at the end of the
day, these are the things that matter most to me.</li>
<li>But at the same time, I <b>desperately</b> love problems. I mean, the world is
truly such a wonderful place, full of so wonderful opportunities and ideas
worth exploring, I feel like standing behind to watch just is not me.</li>
<li>So far: bouncing back and forth. I think this is life. Trying to explore it
all, and focusing on getting the most out of everything.</li>
<li>If it costs me in the long run, I will be saddened, but should I?  The
philosophy of focusing around longevity is strange; focusing on getting old
instead of living the moment? I mean, what&rsquo;s the point in living till 150 if
I am not with the ones I have loved, the ones I have grown to call friends,
the ones that kept me company in this journey. If I&rsquo;m not the best version
of myself, will I be of any help to them? Will I actually give the world
back this unbelievable chance it has given me? Again and again?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
