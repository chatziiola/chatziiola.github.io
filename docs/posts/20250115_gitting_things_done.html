After a long time, I&rsquo;m writing an article, and it sadly is not about
the things I&rsquo;m working on. This one is more like a note to anyone out
there finding themselves in this unfortunate position: having worked
on some projects over the holidays (alas, &ldquo;worked&rdquo; is an
understatement) and on a forcibly new installation, some files were
hastily rewritten/copied, so that I would not lose any time during the
transition. One critical such file was my <code>.gitconfig</code><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org90a1def" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org90a1def"><a href="#org90a1def">Beware</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org90a1def">
<p>
Well, don&rsquo;t pay attention to the fanfare—just make sure to read your
details carefully, or you will find yourself in my position, as I did.
I hastily created a minimal <code>.gitconfig</code> and sailed on, working on my
projects and keeping my remotes up to date, until today, when I
noticed something off with my GitHub timeline<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

        defaultBranch = main

My timeline was empty during arguably one of the busiest periods I had
this year—this could not be right! Heading to one random <code>repo</code>, I
verified that I was not crazy (at least, not that much): the commits
existed there. Strangely, not only did they exist, but their author
was listed as me—it was just that&#x2026; the account was not linked. I
immediately thought of my <code>.gitconfig</code>. Something had to be wrong there.
The files looked pretty identical (at least the critical parts)
between this and my working installation. In fact, the config command
<b>looked</b> the same.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell" id="org8b6741a">git config -l
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But it was not. I had managed to write my email address incorrectly
and, as a result, <b>EVERY SINGLE COMMIT</b> I had made on my newest
installation had the wrong author details. Thankfully, it is easy to
solve, and all that is needed are <del>1</del>, <del>2</del>, and 3 commands.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell" id="org9e075a6"><span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">Find your last "proper" commit </span>
git log 
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">Fix faulty commits</span>
git rebase -r &lt;proper_commit_id&gt; --exec <span class="org-string">'git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author'</span> 
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">Overwrite remote repo, necessary to my knowledge buuuut </span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">well, it will be more painful in shared repos,</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">than it was in my personal ones. Check it first.</span>
git push -f 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These will update <b>all</b> commits after the one specified so that they
have the proper author properties. There is just one funny catch:
since the second command does not &ldquo;modify&rdquo; the already existing
commits but, instead, creates new ones with the same contents, their
date gets shifted to the date that the <code>git rebase</code> command is executed.
This is how the last date in my screenshot is so brightly green&#x2026; I
borrowed something from my past self. ;)
