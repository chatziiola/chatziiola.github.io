<h1 class="title">Starting again</h1>
<p>
In my previous attempts to host my personal website the problem was obvious; I
focused too much on properly defining what my blog should be about that it took
the whole fun of writing out of it. I decided to avoid making the same mistake
again, which translates into <i>more writing, less tinkering with the website</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
I will write on a plethora of subjects, books and ideas that I believe are worth
putting out so that they are improved.
</p>

<p>
Since I have not decided on a topic for an article yet, there are too many I&rsquo;m
after and, to be frank, many that I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t do justice to, I have
decided to use the first <span class="underline">article</span> in my website to thank two people I have
never met but to whom I attribute this <i>new try</i> on a personal blog.
</p>

<p>
I would really like to thank <a href="https://github.com/rougier">Nicolas P. Rougier</a>,  for he is the creator of the
css theme that I have used in this website<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. I first saw it almost a year
ago when I first started reading on <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> and I don&rsquo;t
think I have ever found a styling sheet that I like so much.
</p>

<p>
With that said, I feel it is not right not to mention his open-source work and
thank him for inspiring me to always try to do more. (It still happens, every
time I check his github profile)
</p>

<p>
Also, special thanks go to <a href="https://daviwil.com/">David Wilson</a>, for his excellent videos on Emacs,
helping me gain the most out of Emacs after being a vim user for more than 5
years. It was through his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters">videos</a>, that I discovered how deep one could dive into
emacs and, more important to me, <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> configuration, allowing me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw">publish
my own website</a>, without <i>(relatively)</i> much hassle.
