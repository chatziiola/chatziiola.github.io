Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World</a>. Having
liked it so much and still intrigued in the history of the field, I chose to
dive in it a little bit more.

It surely did not disappoint me.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7819bbc">
<p>
Kevin Mitnick is one of the worlds most famous (and at a given time in history
<i>infamous</i>) hackers to ever exist. He was only a young boy, an actual teenager,
when he first started experimenting and getting unauthorized access to systems
he was not supposed to touch and this passion never left him. He kept doing it,
no matter how difficult his life had gotten to be because of this obsession.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
A master of social engineering Mitnick, with the help of his coauthor, Bill
Simons, sheds light on his extraordinary life, covering <b>many</b> of his
adventures. We can see him evolving from a boy that moved around with <i>his own
bus tickets</i> and lurking in his favourite <i>underground</i> bookstore, to a world
class hacker, escaping the F.B.I. with relative ease and leading a normal life.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, page by page, the reader gets to <i>see</i> lots of phreaking,
hacking, jail time, questionable legal practices by his adversaries and
exceptional social engineering, by the greatest to ever do it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga6add73">
<p>
Social Enginering is a prevalent theme of the book and everyone who has ever
heard of Mitnick can easily understand why.  Under no circumstances can the book
be considered a <i>guide</i> on this field&rsquo;s techniques, but it offers some tips,
always based on the protagonist&rsquo;s own actions:

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org120dcee">
<p>
It is important to use whatever data available to us to gain the SE target&rsquo;s
trust and avoid raising any suspicions. To do that one needs to learn as much as
he can about the company as an organization, the relations between its
departments, the standards/processes followed in the targeted department and of
course, about the way they communicate.
</p>

<p>
Further points of interest may be the targets&rsquo; access to certain information and
the coworkers they interact the most with. Lastly, if you are after a certain
piece of information: under what circumstances are they allowed to share it with
you?

The social-engineering techniques work simply because people are very
trusting of anyone who establishes credibility,

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfc69e91">
<blockquote>
<p>
If you ask for a piece of sensitive information, people naturally grow
immediately suspicious. If you pretend you already have the information and give
them something that’s wrong, they’ll frequently correct you—rewarding you with
the piece of information you were looking for.

This helps the attacker hide their tracks, making the victim feel safe and cast
away any doubts they may have had about the interaction.

An aspect of the book that made me feel unease were the policies that Kevin&rsquo;s
pursuers had, at times, enforced. Obviously, this can not be considered an
objective source to gain information on what happenned but, since I found
numerous reports aligning with Kevin on the matter, I feel that his was, once
again, a case that was heavily affected by the media, who focusing on
<i>entertainment</i> overstated Kevin&rsquo;s abilities, stating, for example, that he had
repeatedly hacked into NORAD. These kind of absurd claims were later on also
used by the prosecution on trial.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga65c790">
<p>
An interesting aspect of the book is the balance between technical details and
<i>thriller-like</i> story-telling. You can not help but smile about the innocence
portrayed in it, get angry at some people&rsquo;s betrayal and in at the same time,
feel inspired by others. It is not a technical read, as it focuses more on the
story than the actual techniques Mitnick used. At the same time, however, the
authors included enough details to make the technical reader happy; filling the
older ones with nostalgia and helping the younger ones, such as myself, gain a
better understanding of how the world worked back then. There are lots of
<i>sources</i>, to go after in your own.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, even though I claim it to be a non-technical read without many
details, it was in this book&rsquo;s pages that I first read about the <code>finger</code>
command. I had never heard of it before.

This happens to be my first book review (or at least, the first in quite some
time&#x2026;). And I would like to thank whoever is reading this for their support. I
plan to write an article on most of the books that I read and find interesting,
so if you liked it &#x2026; wait for me to implement an rss feed :)
</p>

<p>
Why am I doing it?
</p>

<p>
It sounds really weird saying it out loud (?) but it relaxes me and also helps
me put my Zettelkasten notes in good (theoretically) usage and test them at the
same time. I truly believe
