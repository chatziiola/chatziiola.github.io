<p>
Fatal System Error is a book targeted to a niche audience, that is for sure.
</p>

<p>
Menn&rsquo;s writing style has, from my experience, never been good. Personally, I do
not mind it, since I focus solely on the information given, yet it has never
been acceptable for literature, focusing more on the quantity of <i>facts and
details</i> than the storyline. That is what makes this book, just like Menn&rsquo;s cDc,
such a difficult read. Writing this paragraph, it occured to me that the best
way to describe it would be: &ldquo;<i>notes for an article-turned-book</i>&rdquo;. He has done a
tremendously good job gathering and evaluating information, but he did not
combine them properly. Had the author taken some extra time to polish the book,
maybe reading it more thorougly, I would have no trouble suggesting it to
<b>anyone</b>.
</p>

<p>
After all, I think that this book is important. Not only is it <i>an intersting
read</i> but it also highlights some of our society&rsquo;s problems.
</p>

<p>
However, the timeline is not linear, jumping from one place to another in a
random fashion and confusing the reader with much unnecessary complexity. Some
information given is unimportant to the story and the bigger picture, serving
only to the further confusion of the reader and taking away from crucial moments
in the book.
</p>

<p>
I do not want to be too harsh on Menn. I get it: details are not only included
for their intrinsic value, they also help build the protagonists&rsquo; portraits and
I am not sure whether taking every such element out of the book would help
improve its readability. It is just certain that something should be done in
this direction.
</p>

<p>
Taking a step back, to focus on the better part of the book; Its content is
undoubtedly inspiring, terrifying, thought-provoking and, being someone who is
interested in the field of cybersecurity,  I found it very informative.
</p>

<p>
After all, <code>fbi.pp.ru</code> and <code>mazafaka.ru</code> are excellent naming templates for
one&rsquo;s server<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

<h2 id="org4657467"><a href="#org4657467">The book at a glance</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4657467">
<p>
Most of the books content is, honestly, frightening. I could not believe the
levels of corruption worldwide (and how deep its roots are in the Net). Almost
every sentence in the book filled me with sadness and disgust. How can something
so beautiful and <i>universal</i> as the Internet have such an ugly dark side&#x2026;
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org11b4bcd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org11b4bcd"><a href="#org11b4bcd">Cybersec Philosophy</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org11b4bcd">
<p>
The ethics behind this particular aspect of infosec are a constant theme of the
book. Not only do we see Barret&rsquo;s and Andy&rsquo;s evolution on the topic, but through
the pages book the horror that cybercrime entails becomes apparent, just like
the damages for every involved party.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, the reader also witnesses the weaponization of the cyberspace. No longer
would anyone in the governmental bodies care about Barlow&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">Declaration of the
Independence of the Cyberspace</a>; All it does is remind us that cyberspace knows
no boundaries. We are not only its users but its guardians as well and we should
care more about <i>fixing</i> this problem. <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>

<h3 id="orgeb6f8e6"><a href="#orgeb6f8e6">State and Crime</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb6f8e6">
<p>
Even though the book could be considered a <i>brief history of cybercrime</i> it
deals with so much more than just that. What I believe is the most crucial
element in the book, is the power dynamics that developed over time, shaping the
Internet as we know it.
</p>

<p>
Sometime, too long ago for me, yet closer to the present for others, a large
percentage of cybercrime consisted of DDoS attacks, coordinated by criminal
groups and organizations against companies, blackmailing them to get money
otherwise the (potential) clients would have no way of reaching those companies&rsquo;
websites. That did not last for long, though it was not because of the
advancements on the <i>blue-side</i>.
</p>

<p>
There were companies like Barret&rsquo;s Prolexic, actively fighting DDoS attacks and
mitigating their risk, but the threat actors, gaining power from every new
<span class="underline">vulnerable</span> device connected to the internet, evolved much quicklier; It was no
problem even for teenagers to launch DDoS attacks against websites they did not
like.
</p>

<p>
Cybercrime simply moved on. A better alternative to DDoS attack had been found,
and it was <b>Identity Theft</b>. The author suggests some pretty terrifying
statistics here, stating that it is so widespread that more than 4/10 Americans
have fallen victims. But&#x2026; could not the states do something to deal with it?
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately governments of the world did not stand up to the task. While there
was a little bit of movement<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>, there was minimal to no improvement for the
common computer user. Instead&#x2026;

<i>What can we do?</i>
</p>

<p>
While it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the burden we have to bear, there are
things we can do to gradually get out of this cybersecurity mess we have found
ourselves in. The answer does not lie in wasting money on various kinds of
security products to make our machines <i>impenetrable</i>. There is no such
thing<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>. What we can opt for is <i>raising the lower bound</i><sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>.

<p>
Straight from the book:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Turning on a home PC without a strong firewall and without an operating system
and antivirus software that each update automatically is like leaving a loaded
shotgun on the front porch for passersby
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So&#x2026; what to do:
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org1ee8198"></a><a href="#org1ee8198">Keep your applications and operating system out of date</a><br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1ee8198">
<p>
Windows users have a right to feel <i>enraged</i> by that, it is however vital
that you do not miss out on security patches. If you do, there is no one to
blame but you.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org3147f4c"></a><a href="#org3147f4c">Follow some standard password policies</a><br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3147f4c">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use a password manager</li>
<li>Different strong passwords for each site</li>
<li>Use 2FA</li>
<li>Maybe signup on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. This project notifies you of breaches in
which your email is present.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>

<p>
These are fundamental in any democratic society and thus, not limited to the
cybersecurity conversation. Just like it occured to me in footnote <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>,
such actions should also be extended to the environmental public discussion.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An example I would like to cite here, is access to the internet through an
ID card. Terrifying is not it? Yet it was proposed sometime back to become
a law&#x2026;<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Second example: Even though it was not ( to my knowledge ) a result of
public pressure on Google, their approach to China&rsquo;s censorship shows there
is hope.</li>
<li>A good starting point of pressure would be the empowerement of
international internet organizations such as ICANN. Should these bodies
have more control, the internet would be a safer place. A second, also
important point could be made out of the <b>necessity</b> that those in power
<span class="underline">listen to the experts</span>.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li><a id="org74afc6d"></a><a href="#org74afc6d">Listen to the experts</a><br>

<p>
The information security landscape is constantly changing. While the time one
can spend on improving their security is limited and, frankly, not so
effective after some time, try to stay up to date with the latest practices.
