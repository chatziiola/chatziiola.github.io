<p>
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad at <a href="https://ee.auth.gr/">A.U.Th</a>.
Always tinkering with new stuff, you will most probably find me
spending my time feeling stuck in many fields and working on others.
</p>

<p>
Actively working around networks and cybersecurity, while also dealing
with the stress being in that school may introduce into one&rsquo;s life.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, there will be time for everything.

Took some time to myself this weekend and channeled my (not-so)
inner-child into fixing some aspects of this blog that increased the
tension between me and writing more. This was (at least from my point
of view) a giant success, greatly simplifying some obscure parts of my
configuration and allowing for a more unified process in the export
stages.
</p>

<p>
P.S. I was ready to publish the blog (for the final time today) and go
back for a final study session, but I felt it was my duty to express
my thesis on the latest happenings in Greek Universities. While
initially myopic, thinking only of the potential benefits the
introduction of private (non-governmental) universities could have had
in the Greek society and hoping for it to (partly) mitigate the
brain-drain phenomenon, the dangers it introduces along with the
strange circumstances around this legislative phenomenon, has me in
doubt. I just wish it was more openly discussed, allowing for more
voices and opinions to be heard.
</p>

<p>
I intend to post an article about it sometime in the future, should my
progress in preparing for the exams be sufficient. Too much
polarization even among those who <i>fight</i> for the same stuff.

This site, although aesthetically minimal, consists of a plethora of hacks,
inefficiently implemented ideas, python, bash and elisp scripts, org
files and some more :P. If you are not afraid of losing your sanity,
feel free to wonder in the related github repo.</li>
