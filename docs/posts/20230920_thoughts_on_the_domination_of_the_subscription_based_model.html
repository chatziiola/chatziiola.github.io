I am not sure where I stand on that. On the one hand, it may allow for far
greater material comfort, for a plethora of services once available only to
those who had some significant degree of financial stability &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
However, I&rsquo;m also thinking of how sideways this may go.
</p>

<p>
At this point, a subscription means that you essentially fuel the service
provider and in turn, they offer some standard degree of freedom (?) compared to
the free alternatives.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m part of the generation that witnessed a crucial moment in computers. The
shift from local computing and sitting in front of a computer solely for work,
to their domination, through Internet connectivity, in almost every aspect of
our lives - entertainment, news, work, communication. And so, we witnessed many
<i>free</i> services rise, become essentially synonyms to their field and &#x2026; fall to
their <i>subscription-powered</i> TODO enemies.
</p>

<p>
To give in example around media services, playing music, YouTube and Spotify.
For a really long time, should I want to listen to music, I would just launch my
browser, and head to that particularly unchanged through time website, type the
title of the song, maybe append &ldquo;lyrics&rdquo; to it as well, and drift away, to the
rhythm of music. Modifying my browser to have youtube as a search engine, or
creating a small script that would automate that process felt justified. At some
point I think there were no ads. Maybe the whole business model was based around
data collection (extremely interesting and (in a more realistic context)
terrifying). Maybe they thought that through proper data management and
statistical analysis, they could feed this data into their AI models, and better
serve the user.
</p>

<p>
The <i>good</i> part did not last long. Some ads reached us. Some particularly
troubling changes started being made. More adds reached us. More changes
targeted towards polarization and in increasing the difficulty for the end user
to properly filter the <i>bad</i> content. Even more adds. To a point where If I wanted
to listen to a song on my phone, running iOS, I would <b>have</b> to listen to 2 ads,
most of the time non skip-able.
